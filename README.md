# Citizen Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of The Graduate Exchange is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community.

We invite all those who participate in The Graduate Exchange to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open RISD Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open RISD citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in the institution.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, show them that you appreciate their efforts.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

  * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
  * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
  * Collaboration not competition.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory behavior and speech. Come from a place of love and openess.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community members if you notice a dangerous situation, or someone in distress, even if they seem inconsequential.
  * Have someone's consent before touching them.
  * Mindful photography. Do not record without permission.


## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are unacceptable within our community:

  * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting other people's personally identifying information and intelectual property.
  * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
  * Physical contact without consent. 
  * Unwelcome sexual attention. 
  * Disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.


## 5. Addressing Grievances within the institution

All persons have the right to dissent and share their experiences without reprocutions as long as they do not harm other members of the community. We work to actively make those aware of ways the institution have failed individual members of our community in a way that moves towards productive outcomes, even if that primarily in the pursuit of self care and/or protest.   

## 6. Scope

We expect all community participants to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
